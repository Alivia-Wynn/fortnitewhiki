Describe the interactive features you chose to implement and what their expected behaviour is.

1: Home page
	- I added a button to the nav bar that changes the background photo on the home page. I Wanted to have it so that you can click the button many times and have it cycle through photos but I'm still working on my logic. 

2: DO NOT Click Me Button
	- I made another buton that plays a fortnite song when you press it. 
	I used this website to figure out how to play the audio:
